# Kanban Calendar Next.js Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a modern Next.js application that implements a Kanban-style calendar system with responsive design for both desktop and mobile views. The application uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and follows modern Next.js 14+ conventions with App Router.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Application Structure
- **App Router**: Uses Next.js 14+ App Router architecture
- **Server Components**: Leverages React Server Components for optimal performance
- **Client Components**: Strategic use of client components for interactive features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for type safety

### 2. Key Components

#### Calendar Components (`app/components/calendar/`)
1. **Calendar.tsx**
   - Core calendar rendering component
   - Handles the main calendar grid layout
   - Manages date navigation and view switching

2. **CalendarContainer.tsx**
   - Wrapper component for calendar functionality
   - Manages calendar state and data fetching
   - Handles responsive layout switching

3. **ClientCalendar.tsx**
   - Client-side interactive calendar component
   - Manages user interactions and real-time updates
   - Handles drag-and-drop functionality

4. **ResponsiveCalendar.tsx**
   - Adaptive layout component
   - Switches between desktop and mobile views
   - Manages responsive breakpoints

5. **DesktopKanbanCalendar.tsx & MobileKanbanCalendar.tsx**
   - Specialized views for different screen sizes
   - Optimized layouts for respective platforms
   - Platform-specific interaction patterns

### 3. Core Libraries (`app/lib/`)

#### calendar-actions.ts
- Manages calendar-related actions
- Handles event creation, modification, and deletion
- Implements date selection and navigation logic

#### calendar-data.ts
- Data structure definitions
- Type interfaces for calendar events
- Data transformation utilities

#### calendar-hooks.ts
- Custom React hooks for calendar functionality
- State management for calendar operations
- Event handling hooks

#### data-fetching.ts
- API integration layer
- Data fetching and caching logic
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

#### gesture-utils.ts
- Touch and drag gesture handling
- Mobile-specific interaction utilities
- Gesture recognition algorithms

### 4. UI Components (`app/components/ui/`)
- Reusable UI components using shadcn/ui
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility-focused components

### 5. State Management
- Uses React's built-in state management
- Server-side state with Next.js
- Client-side state for interactive features
- Cookie-based persistence for user preferences

### 6. Data Flow
1. **Server-Side**
   - Initial data fetching
   - Static page generation
   - API route handling

2. **Client-Side**
   - Real-time updates
   - User interactions
   - State synchronization

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Server Components for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Image optimization with Next.js
- Efficient data fetching strategies
- Responsive image loading

### 8. Error Handling
- Graceful error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback UI components
- Error logging and monitoring

### 9. Security Considerations
- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure data transmission

### 10. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Feature-based component organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent file naming conventions
- Modular architecture

### Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier code formatting
- Git commit conventions

### Environment Configuration
- Development environment setup
- Staging environment configuration
- Production environment optimization
- Environment variable management

## Deployment Strategy
- Vercel deployment
- Environment-specific builds
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

## Future Considerations
- Scalability improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Feature additions
- Maintenance plans

## Common Questions

### Q: How does the calendar handle different time zones?
A: The application uses UTC for internal date handling and converts to local time for display.

### Q: How is data persistence handled?
A: Data is persisted through a combination of server-side storage and client-side caching.

### Q: How does the responsive design work?
A: The application uses Tailwind CSS breakpoints and custom hooks to manage responsive layouts.

### Q: How are calendar events synchronized?
A: Events are synchronized through a combination of server-side updates and client-side state management.
